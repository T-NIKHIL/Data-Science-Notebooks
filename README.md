Here are some jupyter and power point notebooks I have created that attempt 
to explain some concepts in data science. These notebooks are in no way complete
are a constant work in progress. I will attempt to clean. maintain and update them
as I learn new concepts. As a disclaimer I do not hold a degree in Statistics or 
Data Science and most of the content is based of my reading through various blogpots, textbooks
and videos. I have attempted to provide the source wherever possible but can be missing 
in some cases. If you do find a missing reference or an error in my interpretation please
reach out to me at nthota2@jhu.edu. Hope these notebooks are useful to anyone
starting new in this field. Happy reading !
